This is a basic calculator. It can process event key listeners, negative numbers, floats, and a chain of operations. The biggest challenge (to my surprise) was having the text display from right to left. While that's simple enough to accomplish, it caused problems with my algorithm. I had to write in fixes for specific cases, like a decimal or negative sign which always appeared on the far right of the display but still calculated correctly. 

This was my first respectable endeavor with Javascript. I look forward to being able to clean up the code in the future, as I know it's pretty convoluted and lengthy. Nonetheless, it works, and I'm proud I overcame about 30 "I think I'm in over my head" moments.
